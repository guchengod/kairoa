## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Rust (latest stable version)
- System dependencies for Tauri:
  - **macOS**: Xcode Command Line Tools
  - **Linux**: System dependencies (see [Tauri documentation](https://tauri.app/v1/guides/getting-started/prerequisites))
  - **Windows**: Microsoft Visual Studio C++ Build Tools

## Installation

This project runs a GitHub CI to build binaries for all platforms. Head to [Releases](https://github.com/covoyage/kairoa/releases) and download the binary as per your requirements.

### macOS

Since the macOS binary is not code-signed with an Apple Developer certificate, you may need to remove the quarantine attribute before running the application:

```bash
xattr -r -c /Applications/kairoa.app
```

This command removes the extended attributes that macOS applies to downloaded applications, allowing you to run the app without Gatekeeper warnings.

### Linux

The application automatically handles common display issues on Linux systems. If you still encounter a white screen, it may be due to insufficient permissions for accessing graphics devices.

**Automatic Solution:**

The application automatically sets `WEBKIT_DISABLE_DMABUF_RENDERER=1` on startup to resolve compatibility issues with NVIDIA GPUs and WebKit2GTK. If hardware acceleration fails, it will automatically fall back to software rendering.

**Manual Solution (if automatic handling doesn't work):**

If you still experience issues, you can manually add your user to the `video` and `render` groups:

```bash
sudo usermod -a -G video,render $USER
```

After adding your user to these groups, you need to log out and log back in (or restart your system) for the changes to take effect.

**Alternative solution:**

You can also run the application with software rendering explicitly enabled:

```bash
LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE=1 ./kairoa
```

**Note:** Software rendering may have performance implications but should resolve display issues.
